# Artificial Neuron Network

The term "neural network" refers to an artificial neural network (ANN) (NN). It is a computational paradigm that is inspired by the way the human brain or nervous system performs computation. Perception, pattern recognition, motor control, and other computations are all performed by the brain, which is a highly complex, non-linear, and parallel computation machine. The basic structural unit of the brain is the neuron or nerve cell. Basic structure of neuron network look like below. Where it contains some number of input layer, some hidden layer and output layer. Output produce depend upon which activation we are using.


Humans can complete the work far faster than today's fastest digital machines. This is made possible by the parallel computation of neurons that are linked together.

# Biological Neuron Network
The figure below show the basic structure of biological neuron network. A human neuron consists of a cell body for signal processing, many dendrites to receive signals, an axon for outputting the result and synapses between the axon and dendrites of other cells.




## Modes of Neuron

Basically modes of neuron can be divided into two parts,

* Deterministic model of Neuron

* Stochastic model of Neuron

**Deterministic Model of Neuron** : 

Three basic elements of this neural model are:
Synapses or connecting links, Adder, and Activation Function.


`Synapses` are also the connecting link that are used to link the input of neuron network. Each link is characterized by weight that defines strength of the link.

`adder` : is responsible for finding weight sum of inputs to the neuron.

`activation`: function is responsible for finding the output of the neuron. It is also referred as squashing function.


**Stochastic model of Neuron** : 

For all inputs, the deterministic neural model precisely describes inputâ€“output behavior. However,
the stochastic neuron model causes non-deterministic input-output behavior. The activation function utilized in deterministic neural models is given a probabilistic interpretation in stochastic neural models.

A neuron is only allowed to be in one of two states: +1 (ON) or -1 (OFF) (OFF). A neuron's decision to fire is probabilistic. Let x denote the neuron's state and P(v) denote the probability of firing, where v is the neuron's activation potential.



$$ P(v) = \frac{1}{1 + e ^\frac{-v}{T}} $$ 

This makes the input-output behavior stochastic by adding uncertainty to neuron firing. Everything else in the stochastic neuron model is the same as it is in the deterministic model.

## Modes of activation function



## Activation Function

Activation function which is also called hard limiter function which is responsible to convert input of ANN into output. The activation function is a nonlinear transformation of the input signal. The output is then processed and provided as input to the next layer of neurons.


There are different types of activation function  some of them are listed as below,

* Threshold: 

* Linear

* sigmoid 

* Tanh



## Structures of Neural Network

The structure of neurons in a neural network is referred to as neural network architecture. In general, there are three types of neural network topologies or structures.

* Single Layer Feed forward Neuron Network

* Multilayer Feed forward Neuron Network

* Recurrent Neural Network 

In this blog I am going to describe about how single layer neural network work and how we can do it from scratch.


## Single Layer Feed Forward Neuron Network

It's the most basic type of network architecture. We have an input layer of source nodes that is directly connected to an output layer of neurons (computation nodes) in this architecture, but not the other way around.

## Learning In Neuron Network

The ability of artificial neural networks to learn is one of its most striking capabilities. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) learn by altering the network's weighted connections between neurons. Following are the learning rules for neural network,

* Hebbian Learning Rule

* Perceptron Learning Rule

* Backpropagation Learning etc.

## Hebbian Learning Rule

The rule is based on the idea that if two neighboring neurons activate and deactivate at the same time, they will activate and deactivate at the same time. The weight of the connections between these neurons should then rise.

The weight difference between neurons acting in opposite phases should decrease. The weight should not change if there is no signal connection. This assumption can be described by using following formula.

$$ \delta(w_{ij}) = \alpha * x_i * y_i$$

>>where $w_{ij}$  is weight form neuron i to neuron j,
>>$\alpha$ is learning rate,
>>$x_i$ is input,
>>$y_i$ is output
  

## Hebbian Learing Algorithm

* Initialize all weights and bias to zero

* For each training vector s and target t perform steps 3 to 6
*  Set $ s_i = x_i $ for i = 1 to n
* Set y = t
* Adapt weight as $ w_i = w_i + \alpha * x_i *y$
* Adapt bias as $ b + \alpha * y$
* Test for stopping condition

## Hebbian Learing Algorithm from  scratch

Import module numpy which is used for mathematical calculations.


```python
import numpy as np
```

At first initialize bias and learning rate zero. Define the function `hebb_train()` which train the hebbian learning algorithm.Now run the for loop from 0 to size of observations `dw` and `db` gives updating factor of weight and bias. 


```python
b=0
alpha=1

def hebb_train(x,y,w):
    for i in range(0,len(x)):
        global b
        dw=alpha*x[i]*y[i]
        db=alpha*y[i]
        w=np.add(w,dw)
        b=b+db
        print("After Interation ",i+1," :Weights")
        print(w)
        print("Bias:",b)    
    return w
```

In below block of code shell we define the function `hebb_predict()` which helps to make prediction for hebbian learning model. `z` gives product of input vectors and weight we then put sum of these product into hard limiter activation function and then return output as y.


```python
def hebb_predict(x,w):  
  z=x*w
  tx=sum(z)
  y=f(tx)
  return y
```

Following block of code is for activation function. Here in this example we are using threshold function as activation function. If values are grater than certain threshold value then we give class 1 else we set class 0.




```python
def f(x):
    if(x>b):
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
```

In the code shell below we build four observation having two columns and train y as only column vectors which is result of AND gate. We again take testx is same as trainx. Initially we initialize weight zero. Then we called respective function which we define previously as per our requirement


```python
trainx=np.array([[1,1],[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]])
trainy=np.array([1,0,0,0])
testx=np.array([[1,1],[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]])
wt=np.array([0,0])
print("+++++++++")
for i in range(1,5):
  print("Epoch#",i)
  wt=hebb_train(trainx,trainy,wt)
print("Final Weights:")
print(wt)
for x in testx:
  out=hebb_predict(x,wt)
  print("Input:",x)
  print("Output:",out)
```

## Single Layer FeedForward Using perceptron

The perceptron is the most basic type of neural network for identifying patterns that are linearly separable. Linearly separable patterns are those that can be divided by a hyperplane. Basically, perceptron consists of a single neuron with adjustable synaptic weights and bias.

The pattern classification capability of a perceptron based on a single neuron is limited to only two classes. We can do classification with more than two classes by increasing the output layer of the perceptron to include more than one neuron. For the perceptron to perform properly, the classes must be linearly separable.

The hard limiter input of perceptron is,
$$ v = \sum(w_ix_i + b)$$



Because AND and OR functions are linearly separable, a perceptron can be trained to demonstrate behavior of both. However, because the XOR function is not linearly separable, perceptrons cannot be trained to learn its behavior.

Error correction rule for perceptron : $$ v = \sum w_i y_i $$

Now, we can write weight update rule for nth step as below,

**Case I** : For correct classification
$$ w^T(n) x(n) > 0$$ and $$ x(n) \in c_1$$ then $$ w(n+1) = w(n) $$

$$ w^T(n) x(n) <= 0$$ and $$ x(n) \in c_2$$ then $$ w(n+1) = w(n) $$

**Case II**: Misclassification 

$$ w^T(n) x(n) > 0$$ and $$ x(n) \in c_2$$ then $$ w(n+1) = w(n)-\alpha x(n) $$

$$ w^T(n) x(n) <= 0$$ and $$ x(n) \in c_1$$ then $$ w(n+1) = w(n)+\alpha x(n) $$

Thus, we can represent weight change rule using single equation as below
$$ w(n + 1) = w(n) + \alpha x(n)(t(n) - y(n)) $$ where y(n) is actual output and t(n) is target output.


## Perceptron Learing Algorithm

* Initialize all weights and bias to zero

* For each training vector s and target t perform steps 3 to 6

* Set $$x_i = s_i$$ for i = 1 to n

* Compute output using Hard limiter activation function as below,
$$ y_{in} = b + \sum_{n=1}^{10}(w_i x_i)$$

* Adapt weights as: $$ w_i = w_i + \alpha(t - y)x_i$$

* Adapt weights as: $$ b_i = b_i + \alpha(t-y) $$
* Test for stopping condition.

        d = y[i] - yact
        dw = alpha*x[i]*d
        db = alpha *d
        w = np.add(w, dw)
        b = np.add(b, db)
