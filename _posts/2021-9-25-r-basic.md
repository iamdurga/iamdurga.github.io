# Getting Started With R .

## Introduction
 R is a programming language and software environment for statical computing and graphics supported by the R foundation. R is not like a general-purpose programming language like Java, C, because it was created by statisticians as an active environment. Interactivity is the critical characteristic that allows R to explore our data. It is also a programming language and development environment for statistical testing and graphical testing. Each statistical testing is either linear, non-linear modeling, classification or many more. Different types of the plot are required while doing data analysis. In order to run R, we will use IDE(according to Wikipedia an integrated development environment(IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to the programmer for software development). The core component which is required for every R program is BaseR. These core components contain only the code importing bits that run our code successfully. 


## History About R 
Bell labs develops s language in 1976. In 1993 Ross Lhaka and Robert Gentleman created R in New Zealand. R became a free source in 1995. R version 1.0.0 is released in 2000 to the public. IDE Rstdio is release in 2011.

## Drawback
* R is build by using s. If we want to build apps R probabily one be our choice.
* The object that we work must be strored in memory and working with fetch data set can queckly

## Installing and Setting up R in your Windows
### Step 1: Downloading installation file 
* Download R tools from [Official Website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
* 
Here we are in the page which allows us to install R on our windows.

![img]({{site.url}}/assets/Math_blog/windows 1.PNG)

We need to click Download R 4.1.1 for Windows (86 megabytes, 32/64 bit). We can get this using a simple search just say install R in windows. After clicked there we need to save where we want to store R installer like,

Now it is time to install it for use. After installation completed open R then we get following type of window

![img]({{site.url}}/assets/Math_blog/windows 3.PNG)
It is ready to write first program
## My First R program.
 I am assigning variable in R as my first R programs.
### Assigning Variable and operator in R
 A Variable is a container that stores values. An assignments statements set or reset the value store in the storage location(s) denoted by variable name(by Wikipedia). The assignment operator is a command that is it telling the computer to assign the text apple to the variable product. we can also assign by `assign('products', ' apple)`. We can assign the variable in R in many ways like below.

```R
('apple'-> product)

```
```R
(product = 'apple')

```
```R
assign('products', ' apple)
```
### Logical Operator 
Logical operator means those which gives True and False value. For example
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 3
most_expensive <- banana> apple
most_expensive
```
Output of above code is,
```R
TRUE
```
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 3
most_expensive <- banana< apple
most_expensive
```
Output of above code is,
```R
FALSE
```
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 2
most_expensive <- banana == apple
most_expensive
```
Output is,
```R
TRUE
```
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 2
most_expensive <- banana != apple
most_expensive
```
Output is,
```R
FALSE
```
### Data Type
Data is centre for analysis if there is no data there is no analysis. Every piece of data are working with some characteristics thses characteristics can be summarize with data type.
* character :
It is made by using ' ' marks
* Number: 
Number in R is double. Working with whole and fraction is a unique feature of double. Another is integer. 
* Integer 
Integer is actually simplified version of double. It store data as a string we must use capital latter L. In our use we need to use double rather than integer.
* Logical(Boolean):
Yes or No. Also T or F.
* complex number:
2 + 6i
* Raw:
It not so popular data type. It is not easy to create variable of raw type. If really need to create raw function as a result of calling this function we get

All the fundamental data types are called atomic data.

```R
a <- 2L
class(a)
```
Out put is,
```R
'integer'
```
```R
a <- 2
class(a)
```
Out put is,
```R
'numeric'
```
```R
quantity <- 2
typeof(quantity)
```
Output is,
```R
'double'
```

```R
quantity_integer <- 2L
typeof(quantity_integer)
```
Out put is,
```R
'integer'
```
### comments
Communts are used to give important information about the code. Avoid writing what the code is doing.
```R
# example of function
function1<- function(x,arithematic = TRUE){
    if (is.character(x)| is.logical(x)){
        print("Argument is not numberic.")
    }
    else{
        if(arithematic = TRUE){
            sum(x)/length(x)
        }
        else{
            prod(x)^(1/length(x))
        }
    }
}
```
### Exploring vectors and factors
Data structure as name suggest represent way to organize data to facilate different operaration to perform faster calculations.
* vectors:
Collaction of data of same structure.
* Factors:
Which are used to store catagorical data.
* Array:
Is a matrix which are generalization of vectors.
* List\DataFrame
Elements of different list are dataframe. List are more complex data structure because they allow us to store other list too. We can think data frame as spreadsheets where  data are organize as columns and rows where each column has specific data type. Within a data frame we have all kinds of datatype but within one column we have only one data type. Other criteria to catagorise our data is by dimensional. 

Vector and list are one dimensional objects. Matrices and dataframe are two dimensional data structure. Array are the object that have more than two dimensions.

Note: vector have two property they are one dimensional and containing element of same type.

```R
assign('b',c(1,2,3,4))
print(b)
```
Out put is,
```R
1 2 3 4
```
### Sequence generation
It is used to create sequence of elements in a vector. seq() function takes length and difference between values as optional argument. In a code below, I take elements in the range 1 to 5 in the interval of 1.5.
```R
seq(1,5,by = 1.5)
```
Out put is,
```R
1 2.5 4
```
### Replicating elements
It is used to return the replicating element in the list in a specified times. In the following code I replicate the numbers from 1 to 6 two times.

```R
e<- rep(1:6,times = 2)
e
```
Out put is,
```R
1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6
```
We can replicate the same number at desirable times.
```R
x <- rep(c(1),each = 10)
x
```
Out put is,
```R
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
### Scan function:
Scan function read any file into vector. It is very powerful function. In the code given below scan function read covid data.csv.

```R
f <- scan("covid data.csv", what = "Character")
f
```
Out put of the above code is,
```R
'date,totalCases,newCases,totalRecoveries,newRecoveries,totalDeaths,newDeaths' '1/23/2020,1,1,0,0,0,0' '1/24/2020,0,0,0,0,0,0' '1/25/2020,0,0,0,0,0,0' '1/26/2020,0,0,0,0,0,0' '1/27/2020,0,0,0,0,0,0'

### Vectors attributes:
* length: 
It is denoted by length(a) and its meaning is number of elements.
* Name: 
 names(a), it allows us to add element in the list.
* Type: 
typeof(a), It gives type of data.

There are six vectors types
* Double
* logical
* character
* complex
* Raw
* Integer

```R
vector <- c("Durga","Puja","Ram","Hari")
vector
length(vector) # length 
names(vector)= "Sita" #names
typeof(vector) # type
vector
```
Out put is,
```R
'Durga''Puja''Ram''Hari'
4
'character'
Sita'Durga'2'Puja'3'Ram'4'Hari'
```
### Manupulating vectors.
Manupulating of vectors consists of sorting, ordering, indexing.
* sorting:
* Ordering:
The order function return the index needed to get the vector sort.
* Indexing:
Selecting specifics iteam by position

```R
quantity <- c(1,3,2,5,6,7)
sort(quantity)
order(quantity)
```
Out put is,
```R
1 2 3 5 6 7
1 3 2 4 5 6
```
```R
a <- c(1,7,36,0,7,5)
a[2]
a[3:5]
a[c(2,4)]
a[c(4,7)]# it return particular element from vector
a[-2]
a[-(2:4)] # it skip the element in the vector.
a[a==1]
a[a>3]
a[a %in%c(2,4)] # it gives matching element.
```
Out put is,
```R
7
36 0 7
7 0
0 <NA>
1 36 0 7 5
1 7 5
1
7 36 7 5
```
### Operating vector
Adding or multipling vector of different size is called recycling rule. for recycling largest vector must be multiple of small one.

```R
c <- 1:6
d <- 1:3
c * d
```
Out put is,
```R
1 4 9 4 10 18
```
### Conversion of different type of data into character type is called implicit coercian
R convert coerced data type into character.

```R
x <- c(1,'two',4,"durga")
x
typeof(x)
```
Out put is,
```R
'1' 'two' '4' 'durga'
'character'
```
### Explicit type coercian
* We do this by typing as.desire data type. Explicit type coercian helps us to deal with incorectly catagorized data.
* We can not transfer numeric into character 
* Character into numberic.
```R
num <- 1:5
num_char <- as.character(num)
num_char
```
Out put is,
```R
'1' '2' '3' '4' '5'
```
```R
product <- c("apple",1,"banana")
as.numeric(product)
```
Out put is,
```R
Warning message in eval(expr, envir, enclos):
"NAs introduced by coercion"
<NA> 1 <NA>
```
