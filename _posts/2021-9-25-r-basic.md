# How to Start R .

## Introduction
A free programming language and software environment for statical computing and graphics supported by the R foundation . R is not like a general purpose programming language like java, c. Because it was create by statistician as an active environment.Interactivity is the critical characteristics allow in R to explore our data. R is a programming language and development envorinment for statical testing and graphical testing. Each statistical testing is either linear and non- linear modeling and classification and many more. Different types of plot are required while doing data analysis, according to wikipedia an integrated development environment(IDE) is software application that provide comprehensive facilities to the programmer for software development. Core component which is required to every R program is BaseR. These core components contains only the code importing bits which run our code successfully. 


## History About R 
Bell labs develops s language in 1976. In 1993 Ross lhaka and Robert Gentleman created R in new zealand. R became free source in 1995. R version 1.0.0 is released in 2000 to the public. IDE Rstdio is release in 2011.
## Drawback

  * R is build by using s. If we want to build apps R probabily one be our choice.
  * The object that we work must be strored in memory and working with fetch data set can queckly
## Install and Set up R in your Windows
Here we are in the page which allows us to install R on our windows.
![img]({{site.url}}/assets/Math_blog/windows 1.png).
We need to click Download R 4.1.1 for Windows (86 megabytes, 32/64 bit). We can get this using simple search just say install R in windows. After clicked there we need to save where we want to store R installer like,

Now it is time to install it for use. After installation completed open R then we get following type of window
![img]({{site.url}}/assets/Math_blog/windows 3.png)
It is ready to write first program
## My First R program.
 I am assigning variable in R as my first R programs.
### Assigning Variable and operator in R
 Variable is a container that store values. An assignments statements set or reset the value store in storage location(s) denoted by variable name(by wikipedia). The assignment operator is a command that is it telling the computer to assign the text apple to the variable product. we can also assign by `assign('products', ' apple)`. We can assign the variable in R as many way like below.

```R
('apple'-> product)

```
```R
(product = 'apple')

```
```R
assign('products', ' apple)
```
### Logical Operator 
Logical operator means those which gives True and False value. For example
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 3
most_expensive <- banana> apple
most_expensive
```
Output of above code is,
```R
TRUE
```
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 3
most_expensive <- banana< apple
most_expensive
```
Output of above code is,
```R
FALSE
```
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 2
most_expensive <- banana == apple
most_expensive
```
Output is,
```R
TRUE
```
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 2
most_expensive <- banana != apple
most_expensive
```
Output is,
```R
FALSE
```
