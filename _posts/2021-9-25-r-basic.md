# How to Start R .

## Introduction
A free programming language and software environment for statical computing and graphics supported by the R foundation. R is not like a general-purpose programming language like java, c. Because it was created by statisticians as an active environment. Interactivity is the critical characteristic that allows R to explore our data. R is a programming language and development environment for statical testing and graphical testing. Each statistical testing is either linear and non-linear modeling and classification and many more. Different types of the plot are required while doing data analysis, according to Wikipedia an integrated development environment(IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to the programmer for software development. The core component which is required for every R program is BaseR. These core components contain only the code importing bits that run our code successfully. 


## History About R 
Bell labs develops s language in 1976. In 1993 Ross lhaka and Robert Gentleman created R in New Zealand. R became a free source in 1995. R version 1.0.0 is released in 2000 to the public. IDE Rstdio is release in 2011.
## Drawback

  * R is build by using s. If we want to build apps R probabily one be our choice.
  * The object that we work must be strored in memory and working with fetch data set can queckly
## Install and Set up R in your Windows
Here we are in the page which allows us to install R on our windows.

![img]({{site.url}}/assets/Math_blog/windows 1.PNG)

We need to click Download R 4.1.1 for Windows (86 megabytes, 32/64 bit). We can get this using a simple search just say install R in windows. After clicked there we need to save where we want to store R installer like,

Now it is time to install it for use. After installation completed open R then we get following type of window

It is ready to write first program
## My First R program.
 I am assigning variable in R as my first R programs.
### Assigning Variable and operator in R
 A Variable is a container that stores values. An assignments statements set or reset the value store in the storage location(s) denoted by variable name(by Wikipedia). The assignment operator is a command that is it telling the computer to assign the text apple to the variable product. we can also assign by `assign('products', ' apple)`. We can assign the variable in R in many ways like below.

```R
('apple'-> product)

```
```R
(product = 'apple')

```
```R
assign('products', ' apple)
```
### Logical Operator 
Logical operator means those which gives True and False value. For example
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 3
most_expensive <- banana> apple
most_expensive
```
Output of above code is,
```R
TRUE
```
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 3
most_expensive <- banana< apple
most_expensive
```
Output of above code is,
```R
FALSE
```
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 2
most_expensive <- banana == apple
most_expensive
```
Output is,
```R
TRUE
```
```R
apple <- 2
banana <- 2
most_expensive <- banana != apple
most_expensive
```
Output is,
```R
FALSE
```
