Distinguish between two statements  
$$  
(\forall x \in R)\ ( \exists y \in R)\  (x + y  = 0 )\ and\ 
( \exists y \in R)\ ( \forall x \in R)\  (x + Y = 0)
$$
    
**Solution:**

Here

$$(\forall X \in R)( \exists Y \in R) (X + Y  = 0 )$$

This statement is to mean that for every real number  has a additive inverse this statement is true.

$$ (\exists y \in R)(\forall x \in R) (x + Y = 0) $$
        
Is  not true, since no y will be additive inverse for every real numbers.
