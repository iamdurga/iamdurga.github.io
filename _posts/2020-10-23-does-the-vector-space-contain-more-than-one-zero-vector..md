**Question:** Does every vector space contain a zero vector? Justify. Let s = {0,1} and f = R in f(S, R). Show that f = g and f + g = h where f(t) = 2t + 1 , $$ g(t) = 1 + 4t - 2t^2 $$ and h(t) = 5t + 1.


Solution: Yes, every vector space contaion a Zero vector . Zero vector is a identity  under addition. To be vector space it is necessary to satisfy identity property.

  **Second part**
  
 Here s = { 0, 1} and f  = R in F (S, R)
 
 also,\
 f(t) = 2t + 1, g(t) = 1 + 4t – 2$$t^2$$ and h(t) = 5t + 1 .
 
 Take t = 0 
 
 f(0) = 2.0 + 1 = 1

g(0) = 1 + 4.0 – $$2.(0)^2 $$= 1

h(0) = 50 + 1 = 2 

hence f(0) = g(0) so f(t) = g(t)
        
Take  t = 1 

f(1) = 2.1 + 1 = 3

g(1) = 1 + 4.1 – $$2.(1)^2$$ = 3

h(1) = 51 + 1 = 6  

hence f(1) + g(1)  = h(1)

so f(t) + g(t) = h(t)  verified.
